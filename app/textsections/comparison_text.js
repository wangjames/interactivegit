var text_1 = `Let’s imagine that we’re working on an essay with another person, call him Billy.
At the very first meeting between you two, you both agree to a plan that you should be working on the introduction and the hook to the essay while Billy should work on the meat of the essay.
For the most part, this collaboration seems like it will go pretty smoothly.
You write your part and Billy writes his part and then you two email each other the parts and talk about possible changes to the essay.` 
 
var text_2 = `At some point, you decide that you really like where this essay is going and you want to bring more people onto the project.
Maybe you’d like to hire someone to really come up with a nice conclusion to the essay and that person would like to hire a whole team to work for her.
Each member of this team then comes up with a different conclusion and then passes it up to their boss.
This boss then passes these versions up to you to check and possibly assimilate into your work which is also being modified at the same time with the work from Billy.` 
 
var text_3 = `At this point, you have to ask yourself - is using email for collaboration still a great idea?
You have to keep track of all of these different versions and figuring out good ways of combining all of the different parts.
What if two people are working on the same part and submit two different versions of the same file?
Are you sure that these two people are working on the most up to date versions?
What will this process be like when you add more and more people to the process?`
 
var text_4 = `This situation is a real problem for tech companies and programmers around the world.
Writing software is an extremely collaborative process that can involve hundreds to thousands of programmers all working on different parts of the same project.
For example, a team at Microsoft has 2,000 engineers working on the same project and the Windows codebase involves over 3.5 million files.
Because of this, it is extremely important that there is an organized way for people to collaborate.`
 
var text_5 = `One tool programmers have been using is the source control tool called Git.
Git is a free, open-source source control tool that offer powerful ways for people to collaborate.
In this tutorial, I want to show that Git offers all of the functionality that you’ve come to expect from using email, and I will show the exact workflow to achieve what you are already able to.
At the same time, I also want to show Git’s powerful features and workflows that enable people to overcome the aforementioned obstacles that come with large-scale collaboration. `
